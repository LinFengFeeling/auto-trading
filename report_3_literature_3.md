# Performance Comparison of Automated Trading Algorithms

## Literature Review/Technical Background/Competitor Analysis - 3

Once again, the former example of research (D.Cliff ICAART2019) confirms that an experiment environment closer to real-world financial markets is significantly important as the study of automated trading algorithms is mainly based on observational knowledge. For this study, BSE will be employed to simulate a LOB-based financial market.

BSE is an open source developed and extended by Dave Cliff since 2012. In 2018, [BSE](1) is released as public-domain platform for teaching and research. 

Algorithmic trading systems have been widely used in all major markets around the world. The people who can write algorithmic trading systems and use them quickly and reliably, not only high knowledge of arithmetic also rich experience are required. Moreover, will skilled students in University, offer students a environment where they can launch their own algo is in demand. Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) was developed for students who can gain more experience through the practices.


Up to now, the majority of popular research has focused on regular-sized bids and offers. However, there are relatively few studies in the area of block trading. A [study](2) of dark pool trading was pubilished by S. Y. K. Mo, M. Paddrik and S. Y. Yang in 2013.

In addition, there is a relatively small body of literature that is concerned with if/how known adaptive automated trading strategies select optimal trade in multi-venue environments. ?
