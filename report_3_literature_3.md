# Performance Comparison of Automated Trading Algorithms

## Literature Review/Technical Background/Competitor Analysis - 3

What we know about automated trading algorithms is largely based on observational studies. Much of the current literature on algorithmic trading systems pays particular attention to appropriate simulated environment. Most researchers investigating AA and ZIP have utilised Open Exchange (OpEx).

Most researchers investigating X have utilised OpEx

### An Open-Source Limit-Order-Book Exchange for Teaching and Research

Algorithmic trading systems have been widely used in all major markets around the world. The people who can write algorithmic trading systems and use them quickly and reliably, not only high knowledge of arithmetic also rich experience are required. Moreover, will skilled students in University, offer students a environment where they can launch their own algo is in demand. Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) was developed for students who can gain more experience through the practices.


At trade execution, the execution model executes the trades, making several decisions with constraints on (actual) transaction costs and trading duration. The most general decision is the trading strategy followed by the venue and order type.

The majority of popular research has focused on regular-sized bids and offers. However, there are relatively few studies in the area of block trading.

in addition to that, There is a relatively small body of literature that is concerned with multi-venue trading
