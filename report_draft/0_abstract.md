In electronic financial markets, automatic algorithmic trading systems have largely replaced human traders. Along with the growth of automatic algorithmic trading systems, many of the world's major financial markets are experiencing changes as well, with the rise of dark pools markets being one of the most profound. These changes have created significant demand for automatic algorithmic trading systems that operate in multiple markets. This research aims to investigate if the existing, well-known automatic trading strategies, AA and ZIP, can operate successfully in multi-venue environments containing both light pools and dark pools.
