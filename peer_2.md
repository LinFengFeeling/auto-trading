# Algorithmic Trading on Multiple Trading Platforms

## What is the project trying to achieve, why that is important and how is it different from previous work? (100-250 words)

The objective of the project is to identify and analyse current algorithmic trading strategies, and extend these strategies to increase their profitability in dark pools. Over the last decade, along with an increased number of dark pools are created, more and more investors orders are being traded in dark pools. Therefore, there are critical demands of developing algorithmic trading strategies to benefit from dark pools. A considerable amount of literature has evaluated the current published main adaptive trading algorithms, such as ZIP, GDX and AA. However, none of the previous works has investigated whether those trading algorithms can profit from dark pools, whereas this project will focus on the performance evaluation of ZIP, GDX and AA trading in both dark pools and light pools.

## How is the student going to approach the project and how will the student know if the project met its goals? (100-250 words)

To better understand financial exchanges, limit orders will be studied. Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) will be used to simulate the trading venue. Dark pools will be mainly studied, aiming to better understand the trading market. A simplified version of Turquoise Plato majority owned by the London Stock Exchange (LSE) will be the model of the test environment. As the competitors among the many different algorithmic trading strategies, ZIP, AA and GDX will be investigated and extended in the project.
