# Investigation of timing in markets of automated trading agents using BSE simulation platform

## What is the project trying to achieve, why that is important and how is it different from previous work? (100-250 words)

The objectives of the project are to add a time priority mechanism in the simulator Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE), and investigate how it will affect the performance of automated trading agents. In comparison to human traders, many previous works have proved that automated trading agents are better, since automated trading agents are able to analyse data observed in markets and make trade-offs incredibly fast. In conclusion, speed is the main factor that leads to the success of automated trading agents. However, the experimental systems including BSE provided so far allow automated trading agents to trigger the trade however long it needs, which contradicts the real world exchange markets. Therefore, improving the time element in BSE to favour faster algorithms, aiming to simulate closer real-world markets, is in need.

## How is the student going to approach the project and how will the student know if the project met its goals? (100-250 words)

The student has a clear understanding of how trade happens in the markets. A detailed investigation of how BSE performs in each time step has been done. Several different trading algorithms, Giveaway (GVWY), Zero Intelligence Constrained (ZIC), Shaver (SHVR), Sniper (SNPR), Zero Intelligence Plus (ZIP) and Adaptive Aggression (AA) will be used as the test objects. Three different experimental layouts will be implemented. Throughout the experiments, the performance of different trading algorithms will be observed and analysed. Finally, the results observed in the original BSE will be compared to the results given by modified BSE, then the project can get the conclusion of how time element affects the automated trading agents. Due to the previous research, AA is superior to other algorithms, however, with the improvement of experiment simulation, the results would probably be different.

## How does the student plan to achieve the deliverables and mitigate risks, and is this planning approach appropriate? (100-250 words)



## How well was the research proposal presented and formatted? (100-250 words)

The structure of the research proposal is well organized. Moreover, the technical background is very detailed, specific 
While, in the sections 'TECHNICAL BACKGROUND' and 'LITERARURE REVIEW', adding some subtitles or some short conclution between the paragraphs would help readers to better understand the clue of the sections. A small format error is found in the figure 1 where its description is set apart.

## What should be improved before the student embarks on their project? (50-250 words, can use bullet points)



## Give a mark out of 100 using the modified thesis project marking scheme and justify the mark given (50-250 words)

I give 73/100.
The report is very well organised and the explanation is accurate. The proposal presents the very extensive knowledge of specified experimental system BSE. The student clarified the appropriate methodology of research before the research by referring to primary sources. However, except the format error mentioned above, there are a few of expression errors. For instance, 'a limit price is allocated it is allocated to both a buyer and seller' is supposed to be 'a limit price is allocated to both a buyer and seller'.
