## Literature Review/Technical Background/Competitor Analysis - 1

A considerable amount of literature has been published on algorithmic trading. To better understand algorithmic trading, the [study](1) of Nuti, Mirghaemi, Treleaven and Yingsaeree give a review of algorithmic trading. Due to their study, the type of trading can be categorised into the broker and proprietary. Both AA and ZIP trading algorithms can be considered as broker algorithmic trading systems, the strategy behind is to minimize the cost of trading by minimizing market impact cost or execution time, optimizing the price, and so on. Nuti et al. describe the trading process of algorithmic trading can be slite into four steps: pre-trade analysis, trading signal generation, trade execution, and post-trade analysis. Algorithmic trading can be used at any stage of the trading process for various purposes, such as market making, spread trading, arbitrage, and macrotrading. Both AA and ZIP trading algorithms are used in trade execution for spread trading. In view of Nuti et al.'s summary, there are many variants to the order book model, market orders and limit orders are two main types of trades. Both AA and ZIP trading algorithms use limit orders. A limit order guarantees the execution price, but it may be executed only partially or not at all. Nuti et al. state different exchanges will accept different order types. Choose proper trading venues, liquidity, trading mechanism, degree of trader anonymity, and differential execution costs are considered as some of the most important characteristics. In general, a highly liquid market is prefered, owing to the fast trade execution and low transaction costs. Consequently, to better develop/implement an algorithmic trading system, understanding of the market microstructure, and how the market sorts out orders and executes trades is of paramount importance.

To date, a large and growing body of literature has investigated various strategies of algorithmic trading. In this paper, I will be focusing on Adaptive-Aggressive (AA) strategy and Zero-Intelligence-Plus (ZIP) strategy. In particular, both trading strategies are designed to focus on one specific type of market, the Continuous Double Auction (CDA).

ZIP was introduced by D. Cliff and J. Bruten in 1997. A short [article](2) was published by D. Cliff, it gives the simple interpretation of ZIP. Assume, for buyers, each trader has a maximum pay price l, but quotes a less price p in the market; for sellers, each trader has a minimum sell price l, but quotes a greater price p in the market. ZIP uses m to represent the difference between l and p which is determined by the trader’s margin. By applying a decision tree machine learning model based on observable market data, ZIP agents will raise or lower its margin to maximise the profit. Commenting on entry strategy of ZIP, D. Cliff argues `At the core of the ZIP family of algorithms is a minimally-simplistic set of qualitative heuristics (that is, some rough rules-of-thumb) for adjusting trader i’s margin m at time t – denoted by mi(t). These heuristics depend on four things: (1) i’s current quote-price pi(t); (2) whether i is still active in the market (i.e., still attempting to trade, or just watching); (3) whether the last price quoted in the marketplace q(t-1) was an offer or a bid; and (4) whether q(t-1) was accepted by a counterparty or not.`

In contrast, AA is a fairly recent strategy, published by P. Vytelingum as part of his PhD research in 2006. In Chapter 5 of the PhD [thesis](3), Vytelingum described the concept of strategy applied in AA. In a nutshell, one of the distinguishing features of AA trading algorithm is that it contains two individual adaptive components: a short-term and a long-term learning of the agent’s bidding behaviour. The short-term learning mechanism attempts to promptly respond to market fluctuations. When a bid or ask appears in the market, the agent will update aggressiveness of its bidding based on market data observed. Here, if the agent couldn't transact, it will raise the aggressiveness to increase its chances of transaction; if it did transact, it will reduce the aggressiveness to become more passive in order to increase its profits. The level of trading aggressiveness or passiveness indicates the degree of risk aversion. Higher aggressiveness is associated with higher cost and less risk. Conversely, lower aggressiveness is associated with lower market impact but higher risk. On the other hand, in case of any systematic changes or market shocks, the long-term learning process aid in making bidding decisions. Vytelingum's strategy is to update an aggressiveness model after every successful transaction based on market information observed.
