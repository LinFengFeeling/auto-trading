## Literature Review/Technical Background/Competitor Analysis - 1

There are many studies about algo trainding and electricity market. The studies contributes to the understanding of overview.

A large and growing body of literature has investigated the impact of algorithmic trading on the financial markets.

1. [Algorithmic Trading](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.bris.idm.oclc.org/document/5696713)
2. [Does Algorithmic Trading Improve Liquidity?](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.bris.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01624.x)

The studies about multi-venue environments
1. [Intelligent trading architecture](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.bris.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1002/cpe.3690)
2. [Limit order placement across multiple exchanges](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.bris.idm.oclc.org/document/6327772)

In this study, use BSE
1. [An Open-Source Limit-Order-Book Exchange for Teaching and Research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8628760)
2. [BSE: A Minimal Simulation of a Limit-Order-Book Stock Exchange](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06027)

This study would investigate AA and ZIP. There are some studies about AA and ZIP

Much of the current literature on X pays particular attention to
