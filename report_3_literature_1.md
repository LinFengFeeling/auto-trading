# Performance Comparison of Automated Trading Algorithms

## Literature Review/Technical Background/Competitor Analysis - 1

During the past decade, due to the computerisation of orders, the world has gradually been moving towards automated trading. There is a large volume of published studies describing the role of algorithmic trading in electronic financial markets. To better understand algorithmic trading, Nuti, Mirghaemi, Treleaven and Yingsaeree's [work](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.bris.idm.oclc.org/document/5696713) presents the different types of trading, how a trade is executed in an exchange, and the objectives and challenges.


A large and growing body of literature has investigated the impact of algorithmic trading on the financial markets. The relative literatures have highlighted that algorithmic trading may affect liquidity and volatility of the market.

In this study, among the nuromebr automated trading algorithm, Zero-Intelligence Plus (ZIP) and Adaptive Aggressiveness (AA) are 

The existing literature on AA and ZIP is extensive and focuses particularly on CDA market. Previous research has established that AA offers the best performance of any published bidding strategy.

However, there are relatively few historical studies in the area of multi-venue trading.

What we know about automated trading algorithms is largely based on observational studies. Much of the current literature on algorithmic trading systems pays particular attention to appropriate simulated environment. Most researchers investigating AA and ZIP have utilised Open Exchange (OpEx).
