## Introduction/Motivation

### The brief history of algorithmic trading

What is algorithmic trading? Automated trading systems usually refer to computer programs that create orders and automatically submit trades to an exchange. In general, these systems are deployed for highly liquid markets known as high-frequency trading (HFT).

Back in the 1602s, Amsterdam Stock Exchange, world's first stock market, formally begun trading in securities. In the 17th century, telegraph cables and a fleet of carrier pigeons were used to run a news delivery system. An associated anecdote is known that Nathan Mayer Rothschild knowing about the victory at the battle of Waterloo before the government of London did. In 1983, Bloomberg released the world's first computerized system to provide real-time price feed to Wall Street firms.

Till 1998 U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized electronic exchanges to open the door for computerized High-Frequency Trading. HFT was able to execute trades 1000 times faster than humans. And since that time high-frequency trading (HFT) has been used all over the world. HFT share rises rapidly from 35% in 2005 to 56% in 2010.

On May 6th 2010, a world-scale stock market crash sweep Wall Street is known as Flash Crash. HFT firms were blamed for the crash. However, it couldn't stop the growth of HFT. The share of HFT increased to 70% of total US equity trading by 2012. Along with markets moved to become fully electronic, various evolved markets are created. In Feb 2014, the HFT tool provider started accepting bitcoin for its services.

### The impact of algorithmic trading on markets / interaction

It's hard not to say algorithmic trading and markets having an effect on each other.

During the past decade, as a result of the computerisation of orders, the world has gradually been moving towards electronic trading.

There is a large volume of published studies describing the role of algorithmic trading in electronic financial markets. A large and growing body of literature has investigated the impact of algorithmic trading on the financial markets. The relative literatures have highlighted that algorithmic trading may affect liquidity and volatility of the market.

Many changes in the equity markets and their trading processes have occurred. The most obvious change is that trading has become incredibly fast (High-Frequency Trading). A Lit or light pool market will allow traders to see the amount of liquidity that is posted on the bid and offer of the order book for security. However, HFT became so pervasive that it grew increasingly difficult to execute large trades through a single exchange. Because large HFT orders had to be spread among multiple exchanges, it alerted trading competitors who could then get in front of the order and snatch up the inventory, driving up share prices. All of this occurred within milliseconds of the initial order being placed. To avoid the transparency of public exchanges and ensure liquidity for large block trades, several of the investment banks established private exchanges, which came to be known as dark pools.


Due to the proliferation of online auctions, there is an increasing need to monitor and bid in multiple auctions in order to procure the best deal for the desired good.

Three areas are influencing the future of algorithmic trading systems.

Dark pools are a type of platform that allows the trading of large blocks of shares without revealing quantities or prices publicly (to other traders) until after trades are completed. Dark pools are similar to standard markets (with similar order types, pricing rules, and prioritization rules), but they do not publicly display the order book. These dark liquidity pools offer institutional investors many of the efficiencies associated with trading on the exchanges' public limit order books but without showing their hands to others. However, they are criticized for their lack of transparency and because they could lead to less efficient pricing than traditional open exchanges.

Ultrahigh-frequency trading refers to the buying and selling of stocks at extremely fast speeds with the help of powerful computers. Using algorithms, these computers can scan dozens of public and private markets simultaneously, execute thousands of orders a second, and alter strategies in a matter of milliseconds. In the US, ultra-high frequency trading firms represent 2 percent of the approximately 20,000 firms operating today, but they account for 73 percent of all equity trading volume. In ultrahigh-frequency trading, a trader or algorithmic trading system measures its holding period in seconds, sometimes even in hundreds of milliseconds.

Exchange traded funds combine the valuation feature of a mutual fund or unit investment trust (which can be bought or sold at the end of each trading day for its net asset value) with the tradability feature of a closed-end fund (which trades throughout the trading day at prices that might be more or less than its net asset value). An ETF holds assets such as stocks or bonds and trades at approximately the same price as the net asset value of its underlying assets over the course of the trading day. ETFs provide fertile grounds for algorithmic trading systems because they are a new multiasset instrument that makes their trading more complex, hence they offer a greater technical challenge.

Algorithmic trading might be described as an arms race drawing on the skills of top computing professionals. Traditionally, investment banks and funds hired economists for trading positions and computing professionals for technology posts. Now, given the increasing importance of algorithmic trading in financial markets, firms are seeking trader-program-mers skilled in C-based languages and analytics (such as computational statistics and machine learning). For computing professionals interested in finance, it is a stimulating and certainly well-paid career.
