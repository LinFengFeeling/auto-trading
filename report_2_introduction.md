# Performance Comparison of Automated Trading Algorithms

## Introduction/Motivation

Back in the 1980s, 

Financial markets with fully electronic execution and similar electronic communication networks developed in the late 1980s and 1990s. In the U.S., decimalization, which changed the minimum tick size from 1/16 of a dollar (US$0.0625) to US$0.01 per share, may have encouraged algorithmic trading as it changed the market microstructure by permitting smaller differences between the bid and offer prices, decreasing the market-makers’ trading advantage, thus increasing market liquidity.

Till 1998 U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized electronic exchanges paving the way for computerized High Frequency Trading. HFT was able to execute trades 1000 times faster than a human. And since that time high-frequency trading (HFT) has become widespread.

### The brief history of algo trading and electronic markets
During the past decade, as a result of the computerisation of orders, the world has gradually been moving towards electronic trading. 

Automated trading systems usually refer to computer programs that create orders and automatically submit trades to an exchange. In general, these systems are deployed for highly liquid markets known as high-frequency trading (HFT).

Back in the 1980s, program trading was used on the New York Stock Exchange, with arbitrage traders pre-programming orders to automatically trade when the S&P500’s future and index prices were far apart. As markets moved to become fully electronic, human presence on a trading floor gradually became redundant, and the rise of high-frequency traders emerged. A special class of algo traders with speed and latency advantage of their trading software emerged to react faster to order flows.

### The impact of algorithmic trading on markets / interaction

There is a large volume of published studies describing the role of algorithmic trading in electronic financial markets. A large and growing body of literature has investigated the impact of algorithmic trading on the financial markets. The relative literatures have highlighted that algorithmic trading may affect liquidity and volatility of the market.

Many changes in the equity markets and their trading processes have occurred. The most obvious change is that trading has become incredibly fast (High-Frequency Trading). A Lit or light pool market will allow traders to see the amount of liquidity that is posted on the bid and offer of the order book for security. However, HFT became so pervasive that it grew increasingly difficult to execute large trades through a single exchange. Because large HFT orders had to be spread among multiple exchanges, it alerted trading competitors who could then get in front of the order and snatch up the inventory, driving up share prices. All of this occurred within milliseconds of the initial order being placed. To avoid the transparency of public exchanges and ensure liquidity for large block trades, several of the investment banks established private exchanges, which came to be known as dark pools.
