# COMSM3100_automated-trading

## Outline

Develop a series of simulation experiments that enable studying the performance of adaptive automated trading strategies that can choose between more than one possible venue for executing a trade. Explore the performance of automated trading algorithms AA and ZIP in multi-venue environments.

## Introduction/Motivation

- Evolvement of algorithmic trading

  - The brief history of algo trading and electronic markets.

- The impact of algorithmic trading on markets

  - Many changes in the equity markets and their trading processes have occurred.
  - A lit or light pool market will allow traders to see the amount of liquidity that is posted on the bid and offer of the order book
  - HFT became so pervasive that it grew increasingly difficult to execute large trades through a single exchange
  - Several of the investment banks established private exchanges to avoid the transparency of public exchanges and ensure liquidity for large block trades, which came to be known as dark pools.
  - The motivation of adaptive automated trading strategies which can choose between more than one possible venue for executing a trade.

## Literature Review/Technical Background/Competitor Analysis

- Strategies for automated trading.
- Performance analysis of AA and ZIP.

## Proposed Approach/Methodology/Research Questions

- Simulation of multi-venue

  - London Stock Exchangeâ€™s Turquoise PlatoTM venue
  - Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) open-source simulator
  - Simulation of lit-market, dark-market(with different liquidity)

- Exploration of AA and ZIP

  - perform cross-market trading.
  - compare the performance.
  - analyse the performance.
