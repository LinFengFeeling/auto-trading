# Performance Comparison of Automated Trading Algorithms

## Literature Review/Technical Background/Competitor Analysis - 2

To date, several studies have investigated AA and ZIP by examining their performance. Previous researches (e.g. De Luca and Cliff, 1960; Jones, 1972) have established that AA offers the best performance of any published bidding strategy.

### Evaluation of the “Adaptive-Aggressive” Trading-Agent Strategy Against Human Traders in CDA: AA Wins

the performance of Adaptive Aggressive (AA), a new agent strategy, and ZIP, GD and GDX are investigated in both humans vs. agent and agent vs. agent contexts. Open Exchange (OpEx), an experimental algorithmic trading platform, is used to simulate an electronic trading system. Multiple instances can be developed in Agent Host using OpEx framework. Each Agent implements one specific algorithm and has its own configuration settings. The strategy behinds Zero-Intelligence Plus (ZIP) algorithm is to use profit margin and adjust the margin according to market data observed. GD algorithm seeks an order price which maximises the product of the “belief” functions built from the observed market data. Addition to that, GDX employs Dynamic Programming (DP) to price orders. The Adaptive Aggressiveness (AA) trading algorithm contains two individual components, a short-term and a long-term one. The short-term learning mechanism is used to react promptly to market fluctuations. The long-term learning process aid in making bidding decisions. In total, nine of human vs. agent experiments was implemented, three for each of ZIP, GDX and AA. Overall, the agents performed better than humans. In addition, AA performed the best which gained 27% profit greater than humans. AA, ZIP and GDX were compared to each other in pure robot vs. robot markets. In result, GDX beat ZIP, and AA defeated both GDX and ZIP. Moreover, the mean number of rounds per experiment won of AA is higher than GDX.
