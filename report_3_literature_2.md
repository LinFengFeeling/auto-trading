# Performance Comparison of Automated Trading Algorithms

## Literature Review/Technical Background/Competitor Analysis - 2

Except for original work, what we know about ZIP is largely based upon empirical studies that investigate its performance in a particular market. In the [report](1) published by R. Das, J. E. Hanson, J. O. Kephart, and G. Tesauro in 2001, it illustrated that ZIP agents outperformed human traders in all experiments. Due to the description in the report: The members of the IBM Watson Experimental Economics Laboratory (WEEL) developed GEM which is a special-purpose distributed system for experimental economics. Magenta is a prototype agent environment developed at IBM Resea. Das et al. developed a hybrid system combined GEM with Magenta for the experiments with humans and agents. In the experiments, two different time periods are used for the different algorithms: “fast” agents were defined as 1 second, and “slow” agents were defined as 5 seconds. The results presented in the experiments employed Gjerstad-Dickhaut (GD) fast agents and ZIP slow agents. The interviews with human subjects draw our attention to a weakness in the ZIP strategy. That is if using a specific non-optimal human strategy such as ‘fixed-profit-ratio’, the ZIP agents performed badly. However, Das et al. implemented a modification to the ZIP strategy. As Das et al. observe: `Preliminary results show that the modified ZIP agents retain high efficiency and are not easily misled by the fixed-profit-ratio agent.`. In conclusion, the agents utilized established algorithms, ZIP and GD, outperform non-expert human subjects. As the further work, Das et al. suggest testing their bidding agents against professional equities or commodities traders would assist to uncover more weaknesses in the strategies, thereby leading to significant improvements in the strategies.

In recent years, several studies have investigated the role of AA trader-agent strategy in the markets. A conference [paper](2) was published by J. Cartlidge, C. Szostek, M. De Luca and D. Cliff in 2012. They explored the performance of AA-ultra and AA-slow to investigate markets efficiency. AA-ultra is a fast trader-agents which interval time is 0.1s, and AA-slow is slow trader-agents which interval time is 10s and agents perform further internal calculations every 2.5s. For a market simulation environment, they applied a new series of artificial trading experiments using the OpEx experimental economics system first introduced at ICAART2011. Every time the market was reset before starting the experiment. Each experiment lasted 20 minutes. 3 buyers and 3 sellers each, a total of 6 human participants and 6 trader-agents traded in the market. AA-slow and AA-ultra were homogeneously configured as the trader-agents respectively. As the results presented through their experiments, Smith’s alpha values are lower for AA-slow experiments compared to AA-ultra in every replenishment cycle, indicating that slow trader-agents improve market convergence. In comparison with agents, humans perform better when trading against the slower trader-agents. Moreover, the profit dispersion of agents is similar under condition AA-slow and AA-ultra, yet the profit dispersion of humans and the market is apparently lower under condition AA-slow. Evidence from the study propose that slow trader-agents contribute a competitive equilibrium in the markets overall, and slow-agent markets have higher efficiency.

In a similar vein, M. De Luca and D. Cliff in 2015 [investigated](3) the performance of AA, ZIP, Gjerstad-Dickhaut (GD) and GDX in both humans vs. agent and agent vs. agent contexts. They used Open Exchange (OpEx), an experimental algorithmic trading platform, to simulate an electronic trading system. A primary characteristic of using OpEx framework is that multiple instances can be developed in Agent Host. In another word, multiple agents can be implemented at the same time, and each agent applies one specific algorithm and has its own configuration settings. Not only AA and ZIP but also GD and GDX strategies are explored in their study. The GD agent forms belief functions by using observed market data. GDX is a modified GD strategy, it employs Dynamic Programming (DP) to price orders. M. De Luca et al. made a similar build on the work of previous research. They implemented nine of human vs. agent experiments, three for each of ZIP, GDX and AA. Differ from previous work reported, they used 1s as the timing rule for the experiments, aim to simplify the comparison of the performances of the different trading agents. Overall, the agents performed better than humans. In addition, AA performed the best which gained 27% profit greater than humans. In pure agent vs. agent markets, AA, ZIP and GDX competitively traded against each other. In result, GDX beat ZIP, and AA defeated both GDX and ZIP. Moreover, the mean number of rounds per experiment won of AA is higher than GDX.

Several previous research have established that AA offers the best performance of any published bidding strategy. However, [according](4) to Dave Cliff (2019), AA agents perform poorly in real-world markets. To date, most researchers investigating AA and ZIP have utilised Open Exchange (OpEx) or ExPo, whereas Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) was applied in D, Cliff's research. Addition to this, MAA, modified AA was implemented, in order to run in a LOB-based market. While, for the purpose of evaluate performance of original AA, only applied the the microprice modification. AA was against three other strategies: ZIC, ZIP, and a BSE built-in strategy SHVR
Trader-Strategy Ratios and Supply/Demand Schedules are altered for The experiments. According to Vach (2015), ratios of the various strategies active in the market could affect the measured performance of AA. To avoid this, a large number of trials for any given ratio of the various trading strategies in the market was collected, performance of trading strategies was calculated summary statistics. BSE offers the experimenter a lot of control over the supply and demand schedules (SDSs) used in any one experiment. So far, Supply/Demand Schedules was set as constant or undergoes one or more step-changes, but look-up tables (LUTs) of of real-world financial-asset intra- day time-series was set in this study. explore whether AA dominates in more realistic environments, market’s underlying equilibrium price was varied dynamically. After viewing these results, MAA is again the 3rd-ranked strategy, and again it performs significantly worse than either SHVR or ZIP. D. Cliff claims that when AA is deployed in the more realistic market setting provided by BSE, its dominance disappears.



Taking the AA algorithm and attempting to run it in a LOB-based market reveals the extent to which AA seems designed to fit very well in the Smith’62 style of experiments with periodic replenishment, and is less well suited to a continuously varying market dynamic.
Previous authors have also needed to adapt AA for LOB-based markets
However, the modified AA proposed here is novel insofar as prior authors don’t report using the exchange’s tape data or the microprice.
There is a tension between modifiying AA in an attempt to better fit it to a LOB-based market, and making claims about AA’s poor performance in those markets: the more heavily AA is modified, the more one is open to accusations that the modifications themselves are the cause of the poor performance, rather than that poor performance being a reflection of the original AA being badly-suited to LOB markets. For that reason, in this paper, we keep AA very close to the original, using only the microprice modification in generating the results presented here. 
Varying Trader-Strategy Ratios
The results published by Vach (2015) demonstrated that the measured performance of AA in a heterogeneous market (i.e. a market populated by trading agents with a variety of trading strategies) could be heavily dependent on the ratios of the various strategies active in the market. To control for this, in the experiments reported here we evaluate the performance of trading strategies by calculating summary statistics that aggregate over a large number of trials for any given ratio of the various trading strategies in the market
Varying Supply/Demand Schedules
The review in Section 2.3 demonstrated that typically the supply and demand schedules induced by the experimenter (via the choice of limit prices in the traders’ assignments) are such that the equilibrium price P0 is either constant for the duration of the experiment, or undergoes one or more step-changes, (price shocks) in the course of the experiment, jumping from one constant value to another.
Fortunately, BSE offers the experimenter a lot of control over the supply and demand schedules (SDSs) used in any one experiment. 
To study the response of MAA to continuously-varying P0, we used LUTs of real-world financial-asset intra- day time-series drawn from a range of asset classes, as described in Section 5.2
RESULTS
From Figure 1 it is clear that, for both MAA and ZIP, when either strategy is in the minority (<50% of the traders in the population), the profit scores are roughly the same; but as the proportion increases beyond 50%, MAA’s profit scores are significantly better than those of ZIP.
This may seem like a counterintuitive result: in these experiments the zero-intelligence ZIC and SHVR are scoring just as well as MAA and ZIP. It can be explained by reference to three factors: choice of metric; heterogenous trader populations; and experiment design. 
Real-World-Dynamics Experiments
To explore whether AA dominates in more realistic environments, a set of experiments were run where the market’s underlying equilibrium price was varied dynamically using an appropriate P0+(t) function with the SDS, as described in Section 4.2.
A first set of experiments, involving 858,000 simulated market sessions, was run where P0+(t) was generated from a closed-form sinusoidal function.
Results from these experiments (not presented here, due to space constraints) indicated that MAA did not do well in such circumstances, but were open to the criticism that the P0+(t) functions involved were too artificial, too unlike real-world dynamics. 
Figure 3 shows summary data from these experiments: as is clear, MAA is again the 3rd-ranked strategy, and again it performs significantly worse than either SHVR or ZIP. After viewing these results, there is no reasonable way that MAA can continue to be seriously considered as the best-performing published strategy.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS
AA, when appropriately modified to work in a LOB-based CDA, and when tested in the kind of simple market environment as has traditionally been used in the literature, scores just as well as well-known other trading strategies and is not dominated by them.
AA is very well suited to situations in which all assignments are issued to all traders simultaneously, and in which the equilibrium price remains constant for sustained periods of time, with only occasional step-change “shocks”. Real markets are not like this, and when AA is deployed in the more realistic market setting provided by BSE, its dominance disappears.
