# Performance Comparison of Automated Trading Algorithms

## Executive Summary

### Aim and Objectives

The aim of this project is to examine which automated trading algorithms Adaptive Aggressive (AA) and Zero-Intelligence Plus (ZIP) performs better in multi-venue environments.

Nowadays, there are many different types of electronic trading markets, in order to increase gains, more and more adaptive automated trading strategies are being applied. From among the numerous automated trading algorithms, I will take two leading adaptive trading strategies which were also used in a new study of agent-human dominance in markets - Cliff’s Zero-Intelligence-Plus (ZIP) strategy and Vytelingum’s Aggressive-Adaptive (AA) strategy. The Investigations into their performance in multi-venue environments has increased understanding of the strategies behind them, and resulted in the deployment of better preforming algorithms.

The objectives of this project are:

1. To research the modern electronic trading markets, understand and catalogue their differences, in order to create the proper simulation venues for implementing automated trading algorithms.
2. To develop a series of simulation experiments that will enable study into the performance of adaptive automated trading strategies.
3. To research the automated trading algorithms AA and ZIP in order to understand how they perform the trading, so as to properly evaluate the result when implementing them in simulation environments.
4. To implement AA and ZIP in simulation environments, verify the results and demonstrate the simulation environments are realistic.
5. To investigate the performance of AA and ZIP in multiple simulated environments, and then to compare and analyze the results, while ensuring the experiments have both quantitative and qualitative aspects.
6. To identify the valid elements which affect performance, research the associated works and, ideally, improve how they perform.
7. To write up a thesis reflecting and evaluating the final product and work performed.

### Deliverables

- Based on London Stock Exchange’s Turquoise PlatoTM,  to study the trading venues implemented in the real world, ensure simulation environments are close to the practical venues as much as possible.
- To use Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) open-source to create a series of simulation trading venues. Explore how to apply BSE open-source, and once more understand the different trading venues.
- To implement algorithms AA and ZIP in these simulation environments, and verify these environments are a good model of real trading venues. Investigate and analyze the algorithms performance, classify the results and then identify the important factors and potential risks, with the aim being to demonstrate which algorithm performs better in which environment with what conditions.
- A thesis showing my understanding and knowledge about the different trading venue and automated trading algorithms AA and ZIP, explaining the simulation experiments and evaluating the results.

### Added Value

The simulation trading venues may be used to explore other automated trading algorithms. The analysis may be extended to improve algorithms AA and ZIP or any other algorithms. Moreover, a wide range of people may be interested in this project which including financial professionals and computer scientists. The performance comparison may be applied to choose the right strategies for different trading environments. In economics and finance, for preventing the market being impacted by high frequency automated trading, a new electronic market may be implemented to decrease the performance of the present automated trading algorithms. The result of this analysis may be computer scientists deploying even more powerful algorithms. If my project were to be applied in real venues then it would give a more precise analysis on how they perform in practice.
